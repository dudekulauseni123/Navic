\chapter{Design Parameters}
\section{The Frequency Bands}
\input{bands/navicBands.tex}

\chapter{Channel Modelling}
The phenomena modelled in the satellite communication channel are Doppler shift, delay, power scaling and thermal noise at the receiver.
\section{Doppler shift}
Due to relative motion between the satellites and the receiver, the transmitted signals undergo a frequency shift before arriving at the receiver. This shift %
in frequency is called Doppler shift and can be computed as
\begin{equation}
    f_{shift} = f_{d}-f_{c} = \brak{\frac{V_{rel}}{c-V_{S,dir}}}f_{c}  
\end{equation}
where,

$f_{Shift}$ = Frequency shift due to Doppler

$f_{d}$ = Frequency observed at receiver

$f_{c}$ = Carrier frequency at transmitter

$V_{rel}$ = Relative velocity of transmitter and receiver

$V_{S,dir}$ = Velocity of satellite along radial direction

$c$ = Speed of light

$V_{rel}$ is given by
\begin{align}
    V_{rel} &= V_{S,dir} - V_{R,dir}
\end{align}
where,

$V_{R,dir}$ = Velocity of receiver along radial direction

$V_{R,dir}$ and $V_{S,dir}$ are given by
\begin{align}
    V_{R,dir} &= \vec{V}_{R} \cdot \hat{\vec{dir}}\\
    V_{D,dir} &= \vec{V}_{S} \cdot \hat{\vec{dir}}
\end{align}
where,

$\hat{\vec{dir}}$ = Unit vector from satellite to receiver i.e. radial direction

$\vec{V_{S}}$ = Velocity of satellite

$\vec{V_{R}}$ = Velocity of receiver

$\hat{\vec{dir}}$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \hat{\vec{dir}} = \frac{\vec{P_{S}}-\vec{P_{R}}}{\norm{\vec{P_{S}}-\vec{P_{R}}}}
\end{align}
where,

$\vec{P_{S}}$ = Position of satellite

$\vec{P_{R}}$ = Position of receiver


The Doppler shift is introduced by muliplying the satellite signal with a complex exponential,
\begin{equation}
    x_{Shift}\sbrak{n} = x\sbrak{n}e^{-2 \pi j \brak{f_{c}+f_{Shift}} n t_{s}}
\end{equation}
where,

$x_{Shift}\sbrak{n}$ = Doppler shifted signal

$x\sbrak{n}$ = Satellite signal

$t_{s}$ = Sampling period

\section{Delay}
Since there is a finite distance between the satellite and the receiver, the signal at the reciever is a delayed version of the transmitted signal. This delay is given by
\begin{equation}
    D_{s} = \frac{d}{c}f_{s} 
\end{equation}
where,

$D_{s}$ = Total delay in samples

$d$ = Distance between satellite and receiver

$c$ = Speed of light

$f_{s}$ = Sampling rate

The total delay on the satellite signal is modeled in two steps. First, a static delay is modeled which does not change with time and it is always an integer number of samples. Then, %
a variable delay is modeled which can be a rational number of samples. While modelling the static delay, the entire delay is not introduced so that variable delay modelling handles the remaining %
delay.

To introduce the static delay, the samples are read from a queue whose size is the desired static delay length. When samples are read from the queue, an equal number of new samples are %
updated in the queue. To introduce the variable delay, the signal is passed through an all-pass FIR filter with an almost constant phase response. Its coefficients are calculated %
using the delay value required.

\section{Power Scaling}
When a transmitting antenna transmits radio waves to a receiving antenna, the radio wave power received is given by,
\begin{equation}
    P_r = P_t D_t D_r \brak{\frac{1}{4 \pi \brak{f_c + f_{Shift}} D}}^2
\end{equation}
where,

$P_r$ = Received power

$P_t$ = Transmitted power

$D_t$ = Directivity of transmitting antenna 

$D_r$ = Directivity of receiving antenna 

$D$ = Total delay in seconds

To scale the received signal as per the received power calculated,
\begin{equation}
    x_{Scaled}\sbrak{n} = \frac{\sqrt{P_r}}{\operatorname{rms}\brak{x\sbrak{n}}}x\sbrak{n}
\end{equation}   

\section{Thermal noise}
The thermal noise power at the receiver is given by,
\begin{equation}
    N_r = k T B
\end{equation}
where,

$N_r$ = Noise power in watts

$k$ = Boltzmann's constant

$T$ = Temperature in Kelvin

$B$ = Bandwidth in Hz

AWGN (Additive White Guassian Noise) samples with zero mean and variance $N_r$ are generated and added to the satellite signal to model thermal noise at receiver.

The functions necessary to model the channel are present in the below code,
\begin{lstlisting}
    codes/channelmodel/channelmodel.py
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Transmitter}

\section{Frame structure}
NavIC master frame consists of 2400 symbols, divided to four subframes. Each subframe is 600 symbols long. Subframes 1 and 2 transmit fixed navigation parameters. Subframe 3 and 4 transmit secondary navigation parameters in the form of messages. Each subframe is 292 bits long without FEC encoding and sync word. It starts with TLM word of 8 bits. Ends with 24 bit Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC) followed by 6 tail bits. In subframes 1 and 2 navigation data is alloted 232 bits, starting from bit 31. In subframe 3 and 4, 220 bits are alloted starting from bit 37. For detailed structure of subframes, refer to chapter 5.9 in the doc
\subsection{Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC)}
The parity coding of data signal follows 24Q polynomial for each subframe. 24 bits of CRC parity will provide protection against burst as well as random errors with undetected eroor probability of $2^{-24}$ for all channel bit error probabilities 0.5
\begin{equation}
    g(X) = \sum_{i = 0}^{24}g_{i}X^i\;\;
    g_{i}=1\; for\; i = 0,1,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,14,17,18,23,24
\end{equation}
\section{Encoding}
The navigation data subframe of 292 bits is rate 1/2 convolution encoded and clocked at 50 symbols per second. Each subframe of 292 bits after encoding results in 584 bits. For parameters and coding scheme, refer to below doc
\subsection{Interleaving}
Any burst errors during the data transmission can be corrected by interleaving. In matrix interleaving, input symbols are filled into a matrix column wise and read at the output row wise. This will spread the burst error, if any, during the transmission. For SPS, data is filled into matrix of size 73 by 8(73 columns, 8 rows).
\subsection{Sync word and Tail bits}
Each subframe has a 16 bit word synchronization pattern which is not encoded. Sync pattern is EB90 Hex. Tail bit consists of 6 zero value bits enabling completion of FEC decoding of each subframe in the receiver.

\section{Modulation}
\subsection{Standard Positioning Service}
The SPS signal is BPSK(1) modulated on L5 and S bands. The navigation data at data rate of 50 sps (1/2 rate FEC encoded) is modulo 2 added to PRN code chipped at 1.023 Mcps. The CDMA modulated code, modulates the L5 and S carriers at 1176.45 MHz and 2492.028 MHz respectively.
\subsection{Pseudo Random Noise codes(PRN)}
NavIC uses Gold codes fo SPS signal. They are generated using Linear Feedback Shift Registers. For L5 and S band, the code length is 1ms and consists of 1023 chips. The code is chipped at 1.023 Mcps. Two polynomials G1 and G2 are used to generate the gold code sequence. G2's initial state provides unique PRN code for each satellite. All bits of G1 are initialized as 1. G1 and G2 are XOR'ed to generate final 1023 chip long PRN sequence, the time period being 1ms. For more information refer to chapter 4 in the doc.
\subsection{Baseband Modulation}
The carrier signal is modulated by BPSK(1), Data channel BOC(5,2), and Pilot Channel BOC(5,2). To have a constant envelop when passed through power amplifier, we add additional signal called interplex signal.
